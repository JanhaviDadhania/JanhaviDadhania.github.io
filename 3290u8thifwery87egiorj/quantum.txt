bloch sphere https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/204090/understanding-the-bloch-sphere


1. spin is not how it spins, it's how it's wavefunction transforms on rotation and exchange
2. any quantum state can be written down by a,x,b,phi parametrs but look carefully and you will see b is just under root 1-asquare and 
about x and phi, in quantum mechanics their absolute value doesnt matter only relative matters so it's x - phi. so on verticle axis you
got |0> and |1> and a vs b trade off comes there and the difference of x and phi comes on circle.... at top and botton there are points 
so instead of cylinder it's a sphere.
(so topologically it's like a sphere.)

HADAMARD gate
1. |0> gets transformed in +x state, |1> gets transformed in -x state. +x is 1/root2|0> + 1/root2|1> and -x is 1/roo2|0> - 1/root2|1>
2. and ulta true too. +x gets transformed into |0> and -x gets transformed into |1> state 

In N qubit system if we apply hadamard gate it creates uniform superposition.
