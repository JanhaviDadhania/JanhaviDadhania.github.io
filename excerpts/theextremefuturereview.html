<h1>Painting a picture of 2000, ~25 years in past</h1>

Imagine a world without internet. Imagine your phone doesn't have wifi button, there are not social media apps, no instagram, no reddit, no facebook, no discord, no search engine. <br>
If you want to learn something you would have to go to your nearest library and manually browse through books. <br>
That was the world just 25 years ago. <br>
For people living in 1990s, that was the reality. <br>
Our world has changed a lot in just 25 years. <br>
Today it has become so easy to connect with someone sitting anywhere on the globe. <br>
You can publish your work and everyone has access to it. (tho it's not that simple. )<br>
Not just that, we also have access to intelligent tools like chatGPT/ smart recommendation algorithms that automatically picks best things for you, and personalises your experience on internet. <br>
And because of that lot of us feel that we live in the best time. <br>
Most of us (not even most. wud say, lot of us have access. relatively poor people in Africa, sourth asia still lives extremely difficult life) have access to unlimited opportunities, we could do whatever we like, <br>
we have resources and help available. <br>
Well, it's kinda true too. I feel it. <br>
but <br>
Think how would the world look like to our next generation. <br>
Today's most fancy tools like chatGPT, how would their state be in 2050? <br>
How much medical science would have progressed in 25 years? <br>
Next generation probably would be able to live perfectly healthy life for 100 years or more, WITH CERTEINITY, which is a luxury we don't have today. <br>
Probably we would have spaceships like we see in marvel movies, we could have smart powerful suits like Iron man in future. <br>
Those were the good things, things could go wrong as well. <br>
What if we have another pendemic. <br>
What if people in power launches neuclear weapons on others. <br>
what if there is another world war. <br>
That could be disastroust. <br>
Is there any way we could ensure that we move towards good future and not the bad one. <br>
The first thing to solve that problem is to understand the problem better. <br>
This book, the extreme future discusses the same. <br>
It lists down the fanciest trends of today. <br>
and tries to see what their state would be 50 years from now in a systematic and structured way. <br>
If you like it, check the description what those trends are. <br>
and give this book a read. <br>
The next book we will talk about is on understanding the current world better. see you in next video. <br>
