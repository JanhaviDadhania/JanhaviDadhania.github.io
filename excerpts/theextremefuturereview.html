<h1>Painting a picture of 2000, ~25 years in past</h1>

Imagine a world without internet. Imagine your phone doesn't have wifi button, there are no social media apps, no instagram, no reddit, no facebook, no discord, and no search engine. <br>
If you wanted to learn something, you would have to go to your nearest library and manually browse through books. <br>
That was the world just 25 years ago. <br>
For people living in 1990s, that was the reality. <br>
Our world has changed a lot in just 25 years. <br>

<h1>World Today; 2024</h1>
Today it has become so easy to connect with someone sitting anywhere on the globe. <br>
You can publish your work and everyone has access to it. (though it's not that simple)<br>
Not just that, we also have access to intelligent tools like chatGPT/ smart recommendation algorithms that automatically pick the best thing for you, and personalises your experience on internet. <br>
Because of that lot of us feel that we live in the best time. <br>
Most of us <b>(though not allâ€”relatively poor people in Africa and South Asia still live extremely difficult lives. This came out wrong in video.)</b> have access to unlimited opportunities. We can do whatever we like. <br>
we have resources and help available. <br>
Well, it's kinda true too. I feel it. <br>
but <br>
Think about how the world will look to our next generation. <br>

<h1>World in 2050</h1>
How would today's most fancy tools like chatGPT, evolve by 2050?<br>
How much will medical science have progressed in 25 years? <br>
The next generation will probably be able to live perfectly healthy lives for 100 years or more, with certainty, which is a luxury we don't have today.   <br>
We might even have spaceships like the ones we see in Marvel movies, and smart, powerful suits like Iron Man's.   <br>
Those are the good things, things could go wrong as well. <br>
What if we have another pandemic?   <br>
What if people in power launch nuclear weapons against others?   <br>
What if there is another world war?   <br>
That could be disastrous.   <br>
Is there any way we can ensure that we move towards good future and not the bad one. <br>
The first step to solving that problem is to understand it better.  <br>
This book, the extreme future discusses exactly that. <br>
It lists down the fanciest trends of today. <br>
and tries to see what their state would be 50 years from now in a systematic and structured way. <br>
If you're interested, check the description for more on these trends <br>
and give this book a read.   <br>
In the next video, we'll talk about a book that helps us understand the current world better. See you then! <br>
