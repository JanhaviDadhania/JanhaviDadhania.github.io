1. COLAS:
Coca cola entered Indian market in 1956. In 1974, the Indian Foreign Exchange Act came into force under Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. The Act lay down strict regulations for foreign companies restricting their stake to 40% and requiring them to divest the remainder to an Indian partner. Cola-cola did divest but said that its management would remain wholly foreign. Janta Party and Morarji Desai came into power in 1977, forced the company to exit the country on fully foreign management issue. Post liveralisation it reentered in 1993.
<br><br>
PepsiCo Inc. had entered market with 60:40 with Indian entities Voltas and Punjab Agro Indian Corporation as majority stakeholders in 1989.
<br>
<br>
start of issue<br>
2003, August, Center for Science and Environment (CSE) published reports saying that the levels of pesticide in both coca-cola and Pepsi were unsuitable for human consumption. Products included Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Diet Pepsi, Mirinda Orange, Mirinda Lemon, Blue Pepsi, 7 Up, Coca-cola, Fanta, Limca, Sprite and Thumbs Up.
Anti Coca-cola and Pepsi sentiment led to condemnation in the media, comsuption fell by 35%. First reaction by government was to ban brands. Ministers called for nationwide ban in parliament.
<br>
<br>
Companies did;
1. Cola companies abandoned their rivalry and came together. They released joint statement to reiterate that their products were safe for consumption. <br>
2. Large ads - could be called public announcement - were released to the print media separately by both companies refuting the CSE's claims. <br>
3. They set up rejoinders online and clarified their position on their website. <br>

Gov; constituted joint parliamentary committee on health and safety of Indians. <br>
<b>CSE stood on theri grounds. Head sunita narain insisted the real problem was the usage of ground water that had been polluted by pesticides from nearby farms. This raw material was being used by both cola companies and was unsafe for human consumption.</b>

4. Cola companies cited the government report as their clean chit and went their separate ways as if nothing had changed. <br>
5. Coca-cola waited few weeks and then roped in brand ambassador Amir Khan. Khan claimed he had inspected the factories himself. <br>
6. Pepsi returned with their brand ambassador Shah Rukh Khan. Their commercial ad said, Pepsi is not safe to keep at home, because people will keep eyeing it. The commercial also showed Sachin Tendulkar stealing bottle of Peosi from Shah Rukh Khan. Pun of pepsi not being safe. <br>
coca-cola decided to go safe way, trying to show facotries and Pepsi went other way. They chose to stick to its youth positioning. Pepsi had decided to continue with its regular campaign tonality so as to retain its targeted consumers and at the cost of alienating consumers who wanted Pepsi to turn serious. <br>

re-surfaced issue, <br>
in 2006 again CSE took nationwide study and found nothing had changed.
<br>
companies, <br>
this time companies pointed out to presence of harmful pollutants in other consumables including milk water food grains frutis and so no. Same issue that sunita Narine had been pointing to. <br>

7. KINGFISHER AIRLINES;<br>
Kingfisher airlines was launched as disruptor. Founder and then chairman of United Breweries Vijay Malya said, they were not in transportation business, but in hospitality business. Kingfihser airlines had all the trapping of luxury hospitality brand. When the airlines launched, it sneakily persuaded loyalists of the market-leader Jet Airways to switch over to their loyalty programmes by promising such perks as access to first-class lounges that served alcohol. Their offers quickly set them apart from their competition and made the airlines synonymous with a luxury experience. <br>
issue; The expansion was debt-fuel funded. They continued to borrow in order to add more and more aircraft to fleet. by 2007 they had airlines with 43 planes and 22% of market share in terms of passengers. But the company was bleeding money. Reporting losses since it commenced operations and depending on the parent comapny; the United Breweries group to shoulder it. <br>
They brough first indian F1 team, brought an IPL team, purchased a castle in Scotland and so on. <br>
<br>
Next step; Buying Air Deccan. Kingfisher had long wanted a low-cost additino to its stable as it would not only provide the airline with additional aircraft but it would also give them shot at laundhing international flights, since rules only perimtted airlines who had been operational for five years and owned 20 aircrafts to fly abroad.<br>
Yet the 2 airlines could not be more different. Kingfisher was all about glamour and great service at a high price point, Air Deccan was about cheap feares, democratic travel. Combination of Kingfisher and Air Deccan overtook Jet airways and Air Sahara's. <br>
Kingfisher eventually killed the Deccan brand altogether and rebranded the fleet Kingfisher Red. Kingfisher and Deccan combine had bled over 1600crore in three consecutive years, since crude oil prices during that time had surged to 140$ barrel. Global financial crisis stuck in 2008 and it simultaneously suffered losses of 5.2 billion$s.
<br>
They still decided to keep pumping money into airline, borrosed by pledging his holdings in other group companies, providing for intra-group loads and personal guarantees. He also pledged all of Kingfihser's movable assets to the banks imparting the loans. <br>
2006 loans to expand fleet, 2009 loans as they were struggling to make the Deccan acquisitino work and start international <br>
Some of the banks were SBI, IDBI, PNB. There were total 17 banks.

broke; In 2011. Kingfisher's customers started noticing a series of unexpected flight cancellations. Kingfisher soon had difficulties paying for fuel as costs were inflated by surging oil prices. By then, kingfisher also had shut down Kingfisher Red. Soon, salaries of employees began to go unpaid. Planes stood idle. Staff would begin stage walk-outs and demonstrations asking for money they owned them. Almost all of the company's 4000 employees had stopped work by this point. <br>
Kingfishers bank accounts were frozen by Mumbai income tax department in nov-dec 2011. oct 2012, directorate general of civil aviation suspended airline's licence for failing to address concerns about its operations. <br>
Even though Mallya had exited the airline business when Kingfisher was grounded in 2012 and sold off a large chunk of his liquor business to the beverage company Diageo to pay off his debts, his actions proved inadequate. Banks started to possess his assets.

8. SATYAM;<br>
Satyam computer Service was an IT outsourcing firm that provided software development and ocnsultancy services, founded by B.Ramlinga Raju and B. Rama Raju. <br>
;satyam infoway or sify;<br>
in 2007-8 company posted profit of 30%. <br>
<br>
issue broke; First, news broke in December 2008 that the IT major was planning to spend nearly 7680 crore to acquire majority stake in two real estate companies- Maytas Infra and Maytas Properties. These companies had been founded by Raju before satyam was established and at the time they were bought by satyam, his sons were board members of these companies. <br>
The fact that Satyam wanted to acquire a non-core business - that too through companies seemingly owned by founder's family and posting returns that were nowhere in line with the amounts being offered to acquire them - set off alarm bells among institutional investors and in the Indian Ministry of Corporate Affairs. It took hit in american stock market. <br>
News of satyam accounting scam came our week after the failed acquisition when Raju penned a letter to the SEBI and his board, confessing that Satyam had been falsifying the numbers on the company's balance sheet for years to make it look like it was still turning a profit. Despite it's aggressive expansion plans, the companies revenues had not kept pace and in order to keep the Satyam a success story joing, Raju had been essentially committing financial fraud by lying about earnings. <br>
He quite as chairman. Company had 53000 employees at the time. <br>
As an immediate reaction to letter, stocks fell and investor's lost nearly 14000 crore. Later, Stoke was removed from stock exchange. <br>
Both brothers, along with some other managers from Satyam and their auditors from PwC were charged.
<br>
in 2009, Tech Mahindra, owned by Mahindra Group took over Satyam and new entity formed was called Mahindra Satyam. Company florished.

It was the title sponsor for some of the country's biggest sporting and entertainment events- Indian Cricket team, the force India F1 team and Miss India contest. <br>
<br>
issue; cloaked in secrecy so the world knew nothing of how the group truly made its money or came to be so influential in UP politics,it continued to reign supreme until a simple term called optionally fully convertible debentures <b>(OFCD)</b> unravelled the group's operations. <br>
