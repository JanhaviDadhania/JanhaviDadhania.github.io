<h4>Chapter 1 of the division of labour</h4>
The nature of agriculture, indeed, does not admit of so many subdivisions of labour, nor of so complete a separation of one business from another, as manufactures. It is impossible to separate so entirely, the business of the grazier from that of corn-farmer as the trade of the carpenter is commonly separated from that of the smith.
<br>
More opulent nations are generally more distinguished by their manufecturing industry. (rather than farming. farming is in general more productive but not as much as manufacturing.)
<br>
In other words, in agriculture the labour of rich country is not always much more productive than poor country.
<br>
The corn of Poland, in the same degree of goodness, is as cheap as that of France, notwitstanding the superior opulence and improvement of the latter country.
