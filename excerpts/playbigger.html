<h3><u>Category Wins</u></h3>
<hr>
catchy questions: <br>
what do facebook, google, salesforce.com, uber, VMware, Netflix, IKEA, Birds eye, 5-hour energy and pixar have in common? <br>
in what way does apple work like 165-year-old glass company corning? <br>
why was elvis not just the kind, but a category king? <br>
<br>
they all have to do something with creating, developing and dominating new categories of products and services. <br>

<h4>True stories of kings and kingdoms</h4>
<b>Category kings; they create entirely new categories of business, or entirely new ways of doing things.</b> They play bigger than generic, normal, average companies. <br>
<br>
If you are creating new category, you need to spend time on setting the base. there would not be any pre-demand for it. you might need to convince middle mans , set context for customers. There would not be any existing frameworks, or context to help build. It takes time to build and dominate category. <font color="#9900FF">  thoughts, social media, high internate penetration and digitally comfortable genzs make it easier now)</font>

<br>

Uber is recent example of category creation; Uber made all of us aware that we had a taxi problem, and that the problem had a new solution. Uber did this through the way it designed the company and its service. <b>It did this through its messaging to the public.</b> 
<font color='pink'>category creators need to put this in people's mind that we are the ones that deeply understand the problem. and naturally that will lead people to move to next step that oh you must than have the best solution. people would come to you first to seek solution. and maybe whatever you offer, they would believe it to be the best since you have established that you understand the problem better than anyone else </font> <br>

<br>

<h3><u>Category Kings Defined</u></h3>
The most exciting companies create. They give us new ways of living, thinking or doing business, many times solving a problem we didn't know we had-or a problem we didn't pay attention to because we never thought there was another way. <br>
<br>
<i>they sell us different.</i>
<br>
<b><i>they make what came before seem outdated, clunky, inefficient, costly or painful. category creators owns the problem they are solving.</i></b><br>
customers rush to new category because it makes sense to them. we literally need people to rush to us. <br>
<br>
authors put it this way, "disruption is not the goal. creation is the goal." fair enough. <br>
<br>

<font color='purple'>somtimes VCs go onfunding sprint. tech companies valuations rises. but like disruption, high valuations are the outcomes, not strategy. ! </font><br>

another batch of examples, Tesla, Airbnb, Apple, twitter, snapchat <br>
<br>

In  some businesses, cultural differences or national borders provide an opportunity to create a geography defined category king. eg. alibaba, flipkart and amazon or their country. <br>

<h3><u>Category King Economics</u></h3>
why not generic company and why category creation, because the growth trejectory is steeper and faster than it ever could be for average companies. <br>
every monopoly is unique but they share some common threads, proprietary technology, network effects, economies of scale and branding. <br>
<b>Category is ultimate growth strategy. that is the strategy. </b>
<br>
<br>
In rough times, when money is tight, a down cycle is a fantastic opportunity for a category king to dispense with all of its underfunded challengers and come out of the cycle more powerful than ever. <br>
<br>
<h3><u>Introducing category design</u></h3>
product design <br>
experience design <br>
category design <br>
category design involves creating a great product along with its experience a great company and a great category at the same time <br>
<br>
<h3><u>Bad Category Design</u></h3>

<hr>
<h3><u>Category is the new strategy</u></h3>
<hr>
people today have lot of options. its difficult to decide what to buy. people are overhwhelmed by solutions presented to them. <br>
It becomes much easier - much clearer - for people to think primarily in terms of the problem they want to solve. In that sense, a problem is a category. A company that best frames a problem is the company that often comes to define and take the category. Put another way, winning companies today, market the problem not the solution. <br>
<br>
Your number one job is to change the way people think. Your product, your company culture, your marketing, everything has to be aligned with transforming the way ptential customers think. If you change the way they think, they will change their buying behaviour. More important, if you are the company that changes the way people think, people will see your company as the category king, and you will win the majority of the customers. <br> That is why category is the new strategy. <br>
<br>
<br>
<h3><u>the category strategy </u></h3>
when you have hammer, everything looks like nail. Bill gates had window's so to him every problem looked like it should be solved using windows. <br>
 
<h3><u>Category crowns a king</u></h3>
category needs a king. <br>

<hr>
<h3><u>The Discipline of Category Design</u></h3>
<hr>
<h3><u>great category design in world history</u></h3>
<font color='pink'>thoughts; religion of course.no explaination required, </font><br>
democracy <br>
cloud based application <br>
<br>
how to make machinery attractive and usable for a wide audience. : cars, washing machines, toasters, punch-card tabulating machines <br>
industrial design <br>

<br>
don't think that environment outside company is not in your control. It is. You have to design the category. the press, the funding, the vibe, the competitors. 
<br>
<b> great new category is one that solves a problem people didn't know they had, or solves an obvious problem no one thought could be solved. </b> 
<br>
You have to help people move from the way they used to think, to a new frame of reference. <br>
<h3><u>courage of category design</u></h3>
category design almost always means stepping into unknown teritory. <br>
It requires absolute belief in a category that others can't yet see. You are creating the future you want, not one anyone else has described. You will run into disbelief from customers, analyst, press, and your own employees. push through it. e.g spaceX. no one believed category of space companies that are private. same with tesla cars. <br>
