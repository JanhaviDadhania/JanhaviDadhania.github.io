  <h1>Making Globalization WORK</h1>
  <h2>by Joseph Stiglitz</h2>

  <h2> Another World is Possible </h2>
  introduction,<br>
  - the way globalization has been managed <br>
  The great hope of globalization is that it will raise living standards throughout the world: give poor counties access to overseas markets so that they can sell their goods, allow in foreign investment that will make new products at cheaper prices, and open borders so that people can travel abroad to be educated, work and send home earnings to help their families and fund new business.<br>
  <i>sort of capital market libralization, labour market libralization, libral migration</i> <br>

  <br>
  economics had been driving globalization by lowering communication cost, transportation cost. <b>but politics has shaped it</b>.
  <br>
  former WTO official said that: if the trade libralization - lowering of tariffs and other trade barriers - had not fully delivered on its promise of enhanced growth and reduced poverty, it was the fault of the developing countries, which needed to open their markets more to free trade and globaliza faster. <br>
  an Indian running micro credit bank stressed on downside of free trade for India. He spoke of peanut farmers who could not compete with imports of Malaysia palm oil. He said it was increasingly difficult for small and medium sized business to get loads from banks.(reference: '../excerpts/indiauninc.html') <br>
  Around the world, counties that have opened up their banking sectors to large other multinational banks have ofund that those banks prefer to deal with other multinations like coca-cola, IBM, Microsoft. While in the competition between large international banks and local banks the local banks often appeared to be the losers, the real losers were the local small businesses that depended on them. <br>

  <h3>TWO FACES OF GLOBALIZATION</h3>

  negatives, <br>
  - factory workers in USA saw their jobs being thretened by competition from China <br>
  - farmers in developing countries saw their jobs being threatened by the highly subsidized corn and other crops from US. <br>
  - workers in europe saw hard-fought-for job protections being assiled in the name of globalization <br>
  - AIDS activists saw new trade agreements raising the prices of drugs to levels that were unaffordable in much of the world (IP protection and companies) <br>
  - environmentalists felt that globalization undermined their decades long struggle to establish regulations to preserve nature<br>
  can't accept the argument that economically at least globalization would make everybody better off.
  <br>
  report snippet from world commission on social dimentions of globalization, <br>
  "The current process of globalization is generating unbalanced outcomes, both between and within countires. ... Many of them live in the limbo of informal economy without formal rights and in a swathe of poor countries that subsist precariously on the margins of global economy. ... the global imbalances are morally unacceptable and politically unsustainable."<br>
  <br>
  of course, those who are discontent with economic globalization generally do not object to the greater access to global markets or to the spread of global knowledge which allows the developing world to take advantage of the discoveries and innovations made in developed countires. <br>
  <br>
  There are many forms of market economy. The american model differs from the Nordic countires, from the Japanese model and from European social model. Even those in developed countries worry that globalization has been used to adbance the Anglo-American liberal model over these alternatives and even if the american model has done well as measted by GDP, it has not done well in many other dimensions, such as the length of life, eradication of poverty, maintenance of the well being of those in middle.<br>
  <b>globalization has been used to advance a version of market economics that is more extreme, and more reflective of corporate interests, than can be found even in the United States.</b><br>
  <br>

  <h5>globalisation and poverty</h5>
  life in <$2 a day. extreme poor <$1 a day. Life for people this poor is brutal. Childhood malnutrition is endemic, life expectancy is often below 50 years and medical care is scarce. Hours are spent each day searching for fuel and drinkable water and eking out a miserable livelihood, planting cotton on a semi-arid plot of land and hoping that this year the rains will not fail, or in the backbreaking toil of growing rice in a meager half acre, <b>knowing that no matter how hard one works there will be barely enough to feed one's family.</b>
  roughly 1/6th of world live in extreme poverty. worst is in Africa. With it's increasing population #people in poverty would rise. is rising. <br>
  During the years of colonialism the world took africa's resources and gave back little in return. ... In recent years, they opened up their markets but globalization did not deliver on its promises.<br>
  Globalisation has exposed developing countries to more risk but the markets to insure against these risks are absent. In more advanced countires, governments fill in the gap by providing pensions for senior citizens, disability payments, health insurances, welfare and unemployment insurance. In developing countires governments are too poor to implement insurance programes. <br>
  wealthy has buffer to protect themselves in rough times, poor do not. <br>
  While the idea of democracy has spread. developing countries find their ability to act eroded both by new constraints imposed from outside to which globalization has contributed. Conditions imposed for receiving aid. Conditionality undermines domestic political institutions. The electorate sees its gov bending before foreigers or giving into international institutions that it belives to be run by United States. Thus globalisation has helped spread the idea of democracy, it has, paradoxically been managed in a way that undermines democratic processes within countries. <br>
  In IMF votes are largly on the basis of economic power years ago when it was establised. <br>
