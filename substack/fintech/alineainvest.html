<b>Problem:</b>
Barrier to Retail Investing is too high(vs institutional investing). Each individual is expected to invest their surplus money (same as everyone have to work on personal fitness). And investing is cognitively demanding task. <br>
brute forcing it (asking, trying to motivate people to do it) has not been working. #TODO data on this.

For user, <br>
- Personalisation <br>
- automation <br>
<hr>
some areas inside, <br>
- women targeted solutions (Lxme) (womens have higher barrier than men. if someone could solve for it and onboard all candidate woemns on, it would be great value add. )<br>
- age group 20-27 (those with lower earnings, longer runway) <br> vs age group that has settled down with home, family, with different goals. <br>
- personally don't understand older people much, their problems are going to be irrelevent in few years so that's second interest. <br>

TODOs, <br>
where is it that all interested people are present, twitter? discord channels? instagram, 
probably not, something like blind, hacketnews, trading groups on, buy-sell gurus space?? <br>

how does the profit margins look in this space? vs other space like food. and how is comparative volatility. <br>
On the surface, profit margins are low (less than 1% in finance vs 7-8% in food industry for mediators but finance area is less volatile compared to food e.g zomato, blinkit) <br>

Does retail investing even make sense? <br>
How come no one ever found solution to it? What does decision makers have against it? <br>
