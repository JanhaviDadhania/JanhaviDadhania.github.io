<h1>Are We Heading Towards Large Scale Tech Job Cazualisation?</h1>
Drawing analogy from late eighties enforced cazualisation of labour work,<br>
Companies were finding ways to cut ties to their workforce and travel light. <br>
Companies wanted fluid reserve of part-timers, temps and freelancers to help keep overhead down and ride the twists and turns in the market. <br>
<br>
full-time, permanent, well paying jobs forcefully cazualised to low-paying, temp jobs. <br>
stratigically done by timing it with outsourcing and offshoring to china, India and other third world countries. <br>
<br>
<br>
Recent large scale tech layoffs, companies moving from full-time employees to freelancers, contractors seem very similar symptoms. Could this wave mean large scale tech jobs cazualisation in longer run? <br>
