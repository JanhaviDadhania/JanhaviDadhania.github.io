<h1>Why could reading too many books be bad?</h1>

I was on reading sprint for last 18 months; finished 30 books; but slowly started to realise I was reading too much. <br>
I realised after giving it few weeks of serious thought, <br>
I was reading because I wanted to learn it all from other people's mistakes, <br>
I was seeking to gain knowledge from other people's life's learning, <br>
I was afraid to make mistake myself and learn. <br>
I was cheating; uncounciously seeking to take short cut to wisdom. <br>
<br>
What in them was a wisdom/knowledge/science, is in me(when I gain that knowledge from reading their books) but opiniatrety. <br>
They had, along with conlusion, their journey to the truth but I had only the final result which is nothing but a part of knowledge. <br>
<br>
reading from other people's books is like a borrowed wealth, like fairy money, though it were gold in the hand from which I received it, 
will be but leaves and dust when it comes to me. <br>

<hr>
This all makes sense, but I anyways am reading; I have, for now toned it down a little; cannot stop it entirely :)
