Normal person come across AI story most frequently in, <br>
1. youtube ads <br>
2. instagram content <br>
3. linkedin content <br>
4. chat GPT it's self. <br>
5. Ads on other websites <br>
6. New channels <br>
If someone gets interested and takes one step in, <br>
7. long form courses on startup platforms <br>
8. coursera, udemy, youtube AI courses etc. <br>

<br>
<br>
Instagram content, youtube startup ads, likedin content and ads in India by Indians is FLASHY, hook optimised, fomo generating, and has little nutritions. <br>
I haven't seen anyone who is giving this vibe, "bro, take a deep breath and chill. Your world isn't going to end if you don't learn ai in one day. You need to see the beuty in it, and let me slowly and in fun way show it to you. Let's see where could it be applied in what you are working on."<br>
problem is, people are addicted to hooks(want to learn ai in 10 days, we will get you a job, come and learn the secret only we know and so on.) No one wants to learn it slowly and correctly. <br>
<br>
If India keep telling it's people these type of bad quality stories, than 5 years down the line, the general awareness on AI is also going to be of bad quiality. <br>
