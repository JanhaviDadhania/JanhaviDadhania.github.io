<h2> our stories need to change, we are not cave people now</h2>
Imagine having to discover(need more specific word) concepts of Trust, Hate, Love, Betrayal and so on on your own after you drop on earth. <br>
We don't need to because we have stories that captures the discoved concepts and are served to us starting from younge age. <br>
<br>
Other animals don't have capacity to retain stories in their head, so they act on instincts, hormones(survival, reproductive). <br>
<br>
<hr>
Earlier humans had only two jobs, fight and reproduce. <br>
Their stories are on same, love stories and war stories. It served good purpose, encouraged people to reproduce and fight. People liked those stories.<br>
What is not so good is, we are surving same stories to today's world, where fighting and reproduction are (definitely) not top priority tasks to ensure humanity's survival. <br>
<br>
Analogy - People like fats and carbs foods, so market fulfilled the demand and produced more such unhealthy foods. Similarly, people like love stories and fight stories, media fulfilled the demand by producing tones of stories in these two genera. We need more protein now, and similarly more meaningfull stories(solving world poverty, solving world hunger, motivation to work towards moving towards technological singularity and so on) <br>
<br>
The direction is clear, we shoudl eat more protein, similarly, we need to move towards better stories to move towards ensuring humanity's continuous survival. <br>
<br>
<hr>
<h2>Delicious (tension and release in stories) Nutritious (message, content of your story) stories.</h2>
Can't protein containing food be delicious? It can be, There are ways to do it, similarly How do we produce likeble stories with good message? <br>
<hr>
interesting, "the saying-> everything is fair in love and war." also include love and war. It's 1576 saying, <> used first. sorry I forgot who was she/he.<br>
<hr>
of course there are stories not on these themes and are still famous. <br>
and there are also stories which have no message and just great hooks etc. Are they just delicious without any nutritions? <br>
e.g Attack on titan is very delicious story, and has nutritinos too. <br>
e.g Demon Slayer is very delicious story, but I don't know what's nutritious in it? But it's not bad story tho. <br>
or Am I just over romanticising stories? <br>
I read The Name of the Wind, it's good book, nice sentences and so on, but what was the message? <br>
Harry Potter is nice story too. <br>
3 Idiots, is very famous. Nutritious and delicious. <br>
