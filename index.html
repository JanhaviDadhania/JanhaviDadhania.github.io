        <dd>abstract</dd>
        <dd>Video captioning is a popular task that challenges models to
  describe events in videos using natural language. In this work,
  we investigate the ability of various visual feature representations derived from state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks to capture high-level semantic context. We introduce
  the Weighted Additive Fusion Transformer with Memory
  Augmented Encoders (WAFTM), a captioning model that
  incorporates memory in a transformer encoder and uses a
  novel method, to fuse features, that ensures due importance
  is given to more significant representations. We illustrate a
  gain in performance realized by applying Word-Piece Tokenization and a popular REINFORCE algorithm. Finally, we
  benchmark our model on two datasets and obtain a CIDEr of
  92.4 on MSVD and a METEOR of 0.091 on the ActivityNet
  Captions Dataset.</dd>

        <br><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13706">2. BTech Project on Visual Question Answering</a> <br>
        <dd>abstract</dd>
        <dd>While a lot of work has been done on developing models to tackle the problem of Visual Question Answering, the
  ability of these models to relate the question to the image
  features still remain less explored.
  We present an empirical study of different feature
  extraction methods with different loss functions. We
  propose New dataset for the task of Visual Question
  Answering with multiple image inputs having only one
  ground truth, and benchmark our results on them. Our
  final model utilising Resnet + RCNN image features and
  Bert embeddings, inspired from stacked attention network
  gives 39% word accuracy and 99% image accuracy on
  CLEVER+TinyImagenet dataset.</dd>
