        <br><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.05806">1. Video captioning on ActivityNet</a> <br>
        <dd>abstract</dd>
        <dd>Video captioning is a popular task that challenges models to
            describe events in videos using natural language. In this work,
            we investigate the ability of various visual feature representations derived from state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks to capture high-level semantic context. We introduce
            the Weighted Additive Fusion Transformer with Memory
            Augmented Encoders (WAFTM), a captioning model that
            incorporates memory in a transformer encoder and uses a
            novel method, to fuse features, that ensures due importance
            is given to more significant representations. We illustrate a
            gain in performance realized by applying Word-Piece Tokenization and a popular REINFORCE algorithm. Finally, we
            benchmark our model on two datasets and obtain a CIDEr of
            92.4 on MSVD and a METEOR of 0.091 on the ActivityNet
            Captions Dataset.</dd>

        <br><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13706">2. BTech Project on Visual Question Answering</a> <br>
        <dd>abstract</dd>
        <dd>While a lot of work has been done on developing models to tackle the problem of Visual Question Answering, the
              ability of these models to relate the question to the image
              features still remain less explored.
              We present an empirical study of different feature
              extraction methods with different loss functions. We
              propose New dataset for the task of Visual Question
              Answering with multiple image inputs having only one
              ground truth, and benchmark our results on them. Our
              final model utilising Resnet + RCNN image features and
              Bert embeddings, inspired from stacked attention network
              gives 39% word accuracy and 99% image accuracy on
              CLEVER+TinyImagenet dataset.</dd>
